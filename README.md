# CIS-18A-Final-Project
This is a buisness Program
It allows a user to look at goods and make a delivery
A main part of the program contain Switch statements. It allows them to pick goods and return to menus
When the user makes a delivery. I output the month of Feburary in calandar form.
This allows the user to clearly see all they days of the month of Feburary.
I let the user pick what day and time they want their delivery
I let the user to purchase the furniture or go back to the menu if they changed their mind.
The user can also choose to take a survey in the main menu
I ask them questions relating to the buisness and let them change their responses if needed.
